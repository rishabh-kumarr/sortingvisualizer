# sortingvisualizer

This is a web app made by using html, css and javascript. The main purpose of this project is to visualize how the different sorting algorithm works. Some of the most
famous sorting algorithms are considered while doing this project. The algorithms that are used in implementing this project are:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

This app can be used in analyzing and understanding how the sorting works. I have used the concepts of Sorting algorithms to process and display the ascending order of 
sorting through this project. I have also included the properties such as controlling the size of the array and the speed of the sorting.

WORKING:

On opening the app, we see a random array generated in the form of bars. You can change the size of the array. Number of element that can be considered in the array ranges
from 10 to 150. You can also change the speed in which you want the app to sort the array. Speed ranges from 1 to 5. 

After these, when you desire to have a look at the sorting process. Click on button with your choice of sorting algorithm written on it. The app will sort the array and present
it to you in the time sorting occurs. While a sorting process is being carried out, all the rest buttons are locked until the chosen sorting algorithm finishes its work. If you 
wish to stop the process, simply reload the app.

After the sorting process is over, you can ask the app to generate a new array for you by clicking the button with the same name and it gives you a new random array with the
size you chose. 

Try it out!
